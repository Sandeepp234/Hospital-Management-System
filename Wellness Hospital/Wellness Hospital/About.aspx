        Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital offers state-of-the-art diagnostic, therapeutic and intensive care facilities in a one-stop medical center.
        Wellness Hospital has been supporting the initiative of helping the affected babies by providing very highly subsidised packages ranging from  1,50,000 to 2,50,000 so that more and more less affording parents could muster the required finance.
        Close to 4 to 5 children a week are treated by surgery or interventions free of charge.</p>
